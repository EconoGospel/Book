Understanding how the world works is surprisingly easy. Everything that happens is a transformation or relocation of matter. If things are "alive" then the relocation of matter is guided by information which can keep the order/life/'enduring structure' going. If we understand how information arises and coordinates the transformations of matter that create the biological and socioeconomic orders then we can more or less  understand how the world works.


## Biological and Social Order

Living things and society are self-perpetuating orders that are in continuous cycles of wealth production and consumption. Production involves the transformation or relocation of matter to create wealth, and consumption transforms/relocates wealth/matter in a way that sustains or expands living things/orders and their internal parts/orders. The Sun sends us photons/energy which the process of photosynthesis is able to store in chemical form. This energy is then used to power the cycles of production/consumption. If there is more production than consumption then the order is profitable and thus has additional wealth with which to sustain itself for longer periods and/or grow. For example, paramecium are single-celled life-forms that produce food/wealth by swimming around and swallowing small bacteria which they then consume by digesting and transforming them into the various nutrients/wealth needed to maintain and expand the paramecium's internal order and thus life. A more complex multi-cellular animal like a person, is simply a collection of cells (which are themselves orders) which must be productive as a whole in order to produce and then consume the necessary wealth needed to nourish itself and the sub-orders/organs/cells/organelles it is composed of. Today we not only have biological order, we have social order, or what the great 19th century British intellectual Herbert Spencer referred to as the "Social Organism", which is rapidly growing and increasing its 'rate of production', in other words, the rate at which it transforms the earth's matter into human usable wealth/order/life/biomass. Every year, increasingly automated building-sized machinery in the mining industries scrape/mine less than 10 cubic miles of matter from the earth's massive volume of 260 billion cubic miles. This matter is 'collaboratively transformed' or relocated by billions of people as trillions of dollars worth of wealth in terms of cars/computers/buildings/products/etc. are produced thus increasing the word's economic pie of wealth and social order. These continuous cycles of production and consumption require precise knowledge/information. By focusing on how information arises, spreads, and guides these cycles of production and consumption which lead to order/life/society we can have a simple yet profound understanding of how the entire world works.

## Creation and Spread of Information via Biological Evolution

"Processes of selective evolution" can be said to have created two mechanisms for creating two types of orders/"enduring structures", biological and social. The biological order is created via the well-known mechanism of 'biological evolution' with genes being like the sentences which store the information necessary to create/coordinate life/order. Mutations cause new genes and thus new information to arise which leads to a different life-form which is then 'naturally selected' as it inadvertently competes with others, with the winner reproducing more and thus passing on more copies of the better-adapted/"fitter" genes/information/design to future generations.

There are two simple mechanisms that create and spread the information that coordinates and grows the biological and socioeconomic orders, they are 1) 'biological evolution', and 2) what the great economists of the so-called 'Austrian School' like Ludwig von Mises and his great protégé 1974 Nobel Laureate in Economics F.A. Hayek referred to as 'the market process', and both mechanisms can be seen as having been 



Hayek writes:

>>"We understand now that all enduring structures above the level of the simplest atoms, and up to the brain and society, are the results of, and can be explained only in terms of, processes of selective evolution…"
